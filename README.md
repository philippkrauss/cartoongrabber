# cartoongrabber
The main purpose of this project is to learn [spring-integration](https://projects.spring.io/spring-integration) and 
have some fun in the process. Therefore we came up with the idea of creating a cartoon grabber.

The idea is to grab cartoons from a number of configurable sources (like e.g. dilbert.com) and 
process them in a number of backends. 

This is the first sketch of how the grabber should work:
